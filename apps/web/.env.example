# CRITICAL: Must include /api at the end (all API routes are under /api prefix)
# The auth client and regular API client both use this base URL
# Auth routes: {NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/auth/*
# Other routes: {NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/*
#
# Examples:
#   Local: http://localhost:8080/api
#   Production: https://your-railway-api.up.railway.app/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
